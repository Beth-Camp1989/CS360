Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The developed app, named "Weight Tracker," aimed to address user needs related to weight management and tracking. Users could log their daily weight, set weight loss goals, and visualize their progress over time.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why wereyour designs successful? 
To support user needs a user profile screen was neccesary as well as a weight entry screen to allow users to input their daily weight. I also added a goal setting screen so users could set weight loss goals and 
progress visualization so users may see a representation of their weight change over time. Every design was set around keeping users engaged with the application. My designs were successful because they offered intuitive navigation, 
minimalistic interface which prioritized essential information, and graphical representation for users. 

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
I emplyed a MVC architecturs for a structured and modular codebase. I endurse the app's compatibility with various screen sizes and resolutions. I also ustilized a database for secure and persistent data storage.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
Rigorous unit testing was done to ensure functionality. I also gethered feedback on usability to identify potential issues as well as testing device compatibility. 

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
During the development phase of the app, a notable innovation was introduced to overcome a challenge related to database management. The challenge identified was the need for secure and persistent storage of
user data, particularly in the context of weight tracking and goal setting. To address this, an innovative approach was taken by implementing the SQLite database as part of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture.

In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
The coding strategies, such as MVC architecture and responsive design, can be applied in future projects to maintain code modularity and adaptability. Additionally, the iterative testing process, 
involving both unit testing and user testing, ensures the functionality and user satisfaction of the app, a practice to be continued in future development endeavors.
